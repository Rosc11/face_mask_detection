    "# Face mask detection on a NVIDIA Jetson nano using DeepStream SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Prequisites:\n",
    "* DeepStreamSDK 5.0\n",
    "* Python 3.6\n",
    "* Gst-python\n",
    "* nms\n",
    "* numpy\n",

    "To run the app:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    python3 mask_detector_cam.py \\\n",
    "       no-stream [optional]                 (disables screen display of the stream) \n",

    "```\n",
    "./start.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "This shell command will automatically change your working directory to face_mask_detection (used for systemd service, as mentioned later in this readme).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Using detections\n",
    "To gather detection information, a probe is placed on nvosd. This probe does not interfere with the information processed in the pipeline. It only gains access to frame meta information such as bounding boxes & the frame itself. This means applying nms does not filter the bounding boxes in the pipeline, which is why all predicted bounding boxes are still shown in nveglessink. Nevertheless, bounding boxes and frame objects are loaded in parameters for custom processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models\n",
    "Models were created using https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/face-mask-detection. When creating TensorRT engine files for Jetson Nano, make sure you're using the right version of tlt-converter for your platform (depends on your TensorRT version). This repository made use of TensorRT 7.1 (downloads at https://developer.nvidia.com/tlt-getting-started).\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Doing your own stuff with this repository\n",
    "You can work further with detections & scores in osd_sink_pad_buffer_probe in camera.py (after nms is applied at line 75!)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run script in LXDE-GUI mode\n",
    "For maximum performance while viewing the camera output, we recommend to start the jetson nano GUI in LXDE mode (https://www.jetsonhacks.com/2020/11/07/save-1gb-of-memory-use-lxde-on-your-jetson/)\n",
    "\n",
    "To install LXDE:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/jetsonhacks/installLXDE.git\n",
    "cd installLXDE\n",
    "./installLXDE.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, make sure to boot into lightdm mode:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n",
    "```\n",
    "Reboot your Jetson Nano for the changes to take effect\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run script at boot using a systemd service\n",
    "\n",
    "** IMPORTANT: When trying to execute script at boot, make sure ALL the paths in the script and config file are absolute paths!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new systemd service by doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/facemasks.service\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, paste the following in the editor:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[Unit]\n",
    "Description=facemask detection\n",
    "After=graphical.target\n",

    "[Install]\n",

    "sudo systemctl enable facemasks.service\n",
    "sudo systemctl start facemasks.service\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the script will start automatically at boot!\n",

    "### Important notes\n",
    "* This pipeline is built up with the nvarguscamerasrc command in mind:\n",
    " ```\n",
    " gst-launch-1.0 nvarguscamerasrc ! 'video/x-raw(memory:NVMM),width=1920, height=1080, framerate=30/1, format=NV12' ! nvvidconv flip-method=2 ! 'video/x-raw,width=960, height=616' ! nvvidconv ! ximagesink -e\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    "* As for now, either one of \"videoflip\" with \"method=rotate-180\" or \"nvvidconv\" with \"flip-method=2\" doesn't work when building a pipeline with nvinfer. Reason unknown at this moment.\n",
    "* When working with Python Gst in combination with Deepstream, nv- elements are best use (CUDA accelerated gstreamer elements). Consistency is key\n",
    "    * though, the very first videoconvert is needed to support raw formats\n",
    "    \n",
